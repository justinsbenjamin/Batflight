Flight time, time to take off, and mass are continuous variables, while number of laps and number of shakes are discrete variables and bat ID will be a random effect variable. Therefore in our generalized linear mixed models using either glmer or glmmTMB, the continuous variables will likely be either log-Normal or Gamma, while the discrete variables will likely be negative binomial models. I think it's possible to use both the discrete and continuous fixed effects in the same model? As a repeated measures design, we can test other interesting things such as: does bat willingness correlate with bat flight, do individual bats have good vs. bad flight days? We have not yet decided how we will propery test these. 
When making our models, we will start by looking at diagnostics from the performance or DHARMa packages to see if the model is a good fit.
